- Accent color: Electric Blue (#7DF9FF), analogous to neon green and providing good contrast in brightness and saturation for secondary interactive elements.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a modern and techy feel, for headlines. Body text font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) to ensure readability.
- Use minimalist line icons with neon green accents to represent each service and technology.
- Implement a responsive, grid-based layout with floating circular shapes and clean spacing to mimic the template's visual style.
- Incorporate smooth transitions, scroll-based reveals, subtle fades, parallax effects, and 3D depth animations for the work gallery.
